# TuneWorks Growth Strategy: End-to-End SQL Analysis 🎵

> **Role:** Data Analyst | **Team:** 6 Members
> **Tech Stack:** SQL (PostgreSQL), Advanced Excel, GenAI (Gemini)

## 📖 Project Overview
Designed and executed an **end-to-end data analysis solution** for TuneWorks, an entertainment booking agency facing revenue stagnation. Our team analyzed the complete data lifecycle—from cleaning raw booking logs to delivering strategic revenue optimization plans.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
* **Data Quality Audit:** Conducted rigorous data cleaning to ensure integrity across customer, agent, and engagement tables.
* **Revenue Optimization:** Identified high-value "Band" bookings vs. "Solo" acts to restructure commission incentives.
* **Human vs. AI Benchmarking:** Pitched human-derived insights against AI (Gemini) analysis to evaluate the depth and accuracy of automated analytics.

## 🛠️ Technical Approach (End-to-End)
1.  **Data Ingestion & Cleaning:** * Utilized Regex in SQL to identify inconsistent zip codes, phone numbers, and email formats.
    * Verified referential integrity across 8+ relational tables.
2.  **Analysis & Modeling:** * Employed complex queries (`JOINs`, `CTEs`, `Window Functions`) to calculate agent revenue performance.
    * Performed hypothesis testing on customer preferences vs. actual purchasing behavior.
3.  **Strategy Formulation:** * Synthesized quantitative findings into a coherent business strategy for the executive board.

## 📊 Key Findings
* **The "Jazz Paradox":** Customers self-reported high interest in Jazz, but actual booking data showed negligible revenue from this genre. *Insight: Strategy based on survey data alone is misleading.*
* **Resource Misallocation:** Top-performing agents (generating ~$15k+ revenue) were under-supported, while low-margin agents consumed disproportionate resources.
* **AI Assessment:** While AI provided quick summaries, our manual SQL analysis was required to identify specific, actionable anomalies in the commission structure that AI missed.

## 👥 Team Contribution
This was a collaborative group project. My specific contributions included:
* **Univariate Analysis:** Led the breakdown of single-variable trends.
* **Strategy Integration:** Synthesized the final executive presentation.
* **Code Review:** Collaborated on SQL logic validation.

## 📂 Files Included
* `TuneWorks_Strategy_Deck.pdf`: Executive presentation of findings and recommendations.
* `SQL_Analysis_Process.pdf`: Detailed documentation of SQL queries and data checks.
* `analysis_queries.sql`: Raw SQL scripts used for the project.
