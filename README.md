# Screen Time & Mental Health: Statistical Analysis 📱🧠

> **Role:** Data Analyst | **Team:** A4ever (7 Members)

## 📖 Project Overview
In an era of hyper-connectivity, our team conducted a rigorous statistical study to quantify the relationship between **Average Daily Screen Time** and **Mental Health Scores** (Anxiety, Depression, Stress indicators).
Using a dataset of 2,000+ individuals, we moved beyond anecdotal evidence to determine if digital dependency has a statistically significant negative impact on well-being.

## ⚠️ The Research Question
> *Does increased screen time cause a statistically significant decline in mental health scores?*

## 🔬 Methodology
* **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and outliers in demographic data (Age, Location, Gender).
* **Hypothesis Testing:** Conducted **2-sided T-tests** to compare mental health scores across different user groups (e.g., Wellness App Users vs. Non-Users).
* **Regression Analysis:** Built a linear regression model to isolate the coefficient of screen time on mental health, controlling for variables like age and location.

## 📊 Key Findings (The "0.35" Drop)
Our analysis revealed a clear, quantifiable negative correlation:
1.  **The -0.35 Impact:** For every **1 additional hour** of daily screen time, an individual's Mental Health Score decreases by **0.35 points** ($p$-value: 0.0245, statistically significant).
2.  **Demographic Nuances:**
    * **Urban vs. Rural:** The negative impact is more pronounced in urban populations.
    * **Age Groups:** Teenagers showed a higher sensitivity to screen time compared to older adults.
3.  **Wellness Apps:** Paradoxically, users of "Wellness Apps" did not show significantly higher mental health scores, suggesting that app usage alone is not a cure.

## 💡 Business & Social Implications
* **Platform Responsibility:** Tech companies (like TikTok/Instagram) have a data-backed directive to implement "Digital Wellbeing" features (e.g., mandatory breaks).
* **Policy Making:** The findings support initiatives for "Screen-Free Zones" in educational environments.
